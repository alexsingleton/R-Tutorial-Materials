# 7. Converting Coordinates

Sometimes you will need to convert spatial data from one coordinate system to another. This is often called reprojecting as different coordinate systems typically use different projections; i.e. the way in which the curved Earth is represented as a flat surface. There are lots of different projections, including the Mercator and Gall-Peters projections, as shown below:

This helpsheet will take you through the process of converting BNG (British National Grid coordinates, Eastings and Northings) to Latitude and Longitude which requires reprojection between the OSBG36 and WGS84 datums. The same principle can be applied to any re-projection though. 

### Setup

There are some initial commands we need to run to setup R for this exercise. Firstly, loading the required library, and secondly, declaring some variables for the two different types of coordinate systems we will be using. 

```{r,results='hide',message=FALSE}
  # Load the packages
  library(rgdal)

  #Variables for holding the coordinate system types (see: http://www.epsg.org/ for details)
  ukgrid = "+init=epsg:27700"
  latlong = "+init=epsg:4326"
```

We will use the locations of doctors surgeries data as an example. Download and import it using the following commands:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
  setwd("/Users/nickbearman/Dropbox/r-helpsheets/helpsheets/7-converting-coordinates")
```
<!---
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
  setwd("C:/Users/Nick & Louise/Dropbox/r-helpsheets/helpsheets/7-converting-coordinates")
```
-->
```{r,eval=FALSE,results='hide'}
  # Set working directory
  setwd("M:/R work")

  # Download data.zip from the web
  download.file("http://data.alex-singleton.com/r-helpsheets/7/data.zip", "data.zip")

  # Unzip file
  unzip("data.zip")
```
```{r,results='hide',comment=NA}
  # Get doctors surgeries data
  GP <- read.csv("General Practices 2006.csv", header = TRUE, skip = 3)

  # Extract the columns we want
  GP <- subset(GP, select =c("Practice.Doctor.s.Name", "Easting", "Northing"))

  # Rename the columns to something more helpful
  colnames(GP) <- c("Surgery", "Easting", "Northing")
```

We now have the doctors surgeries, with their eastings and northings. To show a summary, run:

```{r,warning=FALSE,comment=NA}
  head(GP)
```

We next need to convert the GP object from a data frame into a Spatial Data Frame. 

```{r,results='hide',comment=NA}
  # Remove those doctors surgeries with missing Eastings or Northings
  GP <- subset(GP, Easting != "" | Northing != "")
  # Create a unique ID for each GP
  GP$GP_ID <- 1:nrow(GP)
  # Create coordinates variable
  coords <- cbind(Easting = as.numeric(as.character(GP$Easting)), Northing = as.numeric(as.character(GP$Northing)))
  # Create the SpatialPointsDataFrame
  GP_SP <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, data = data.frame(GP$Surgery, GP$GP_ID), proj4string = CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))                                
```

`GP_SP` is now a spatial data frame. We can do a quick `plot(GP_SP)` to see what this looks like. 

```{r,eval=FALSE,results='hide'} 
  # Show the results
  plot(GP_SP)       
```

```{r,results='hide',echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
  pdf('plot1.pdf', 5, 5)
  plot(GP_SP)
  dev.off()
```

![Image](plot1.pdf)\



Because `GP_SP` is now a Spatial Data Frame, we need to use `head(GP_SP@data)` to view content. 

```{r,eval=FALSE} 
  head(GP_SP@data)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,comment=NA}
  head(GP_SP@data)
```

You can see that the Eastings and Northings are no longer visible. In fact the eastings and northings are just stored in a different slot of the Spatial Data Frame. Try `head(GP_SP@coords)` instead. 

```{r,eval=FALSE} 
  head(GP_SP@coords)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,comment=NA}
  head(GP_SP@coords)
```

And there they are! The `Coords` slot will behave like a normal data frame, so we can access specific elements of it in the usual way, for example `head(GP_SP@coords[,1])`. See the helpsheet "1. R Basics" for more information on data frames. 

Now, the command to reproject from British National Grid (Eastings and Northings) into WGS84 (Latitude and Longitude).

```{r,results='hide',comment=NA}
  #Convert from Eastings and Northings to Latitude and Longitude
  GP_SP_LL <- spTransform(GP_SP, CRS(latlong))
  # we also need to rename the columns
  colnames(GP_SP_LL@coords)[colnames(GP_SP_LL@coords)=="Easting"] <- "Longitude"
  colnames(GP_SP_LL@coords)[colnames(GP_SP_LL@coords)=="Northing"] <- "Latitude"
```

```{r,results='hide'}
  head(GP_SP_LL@coords)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,comment=NA}
  head(GP_SP_LL@coords)
```

Now the data are in Latitude and Longitude.
